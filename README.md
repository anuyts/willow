Personal agda library. It is called willow because it needed a name.

## willow
This is the old version.

basic contains basic type theory stuff.

cat contains category theory.

cat2 is discontinued.

You need to call the repository directory on your computer 'willow' for the directory structure to work. This is so that you can easily refer to it as a library from parallel projects.
